# Scope

Canonical non-session and non-telemetry product facts in pibo.sqlite; normalized history ingestion; external payload bytes and metadata; room, history, timeline, read-state, and event-command projections.

This specification describes implemented behavior at the traceability commit. Planned behavior and contracts assigned to related concepts are outside its normative scope.

# Current behavior

- Persistence and models: PIBO_DATA_SCHEMA_VERSION=6; rooms; payloads; event_log; chat_messages; observations; session_stats; app_session_read_state; app_room_read_state; session_navigation; indexer_offsets; migration_import_map; external payload root with SHA-256 metadata, refcounting, gzip/identity encoding.
- Routes and protocols: No HTTP route is owned; Chat query services are consumed by Web routes.
- State transitions: User acceptance and output ingestion append idempotent event facts, then shadow normalized messages/observations. Client transaction IDs deduplicate retries; repeated text without a transaction ID remains distinct. Output identity collisions throw PiboOutputIdentityCollisionError instead of silently dropping data. Read cursors advance monotonically.
- Failure and security: Bounded payload reads verify size and SHA-256. Deferred payload authorization requires exact bounded session/tool/event evidence and fails closed on ambiguity or SQL cap overflow. Missing or corrupt external payload content falls back to the durable preview where the history service supports it.
- Compatibility: Legacy Pi binding columns are backfilled and old-writer Pi updates are synchronized by migration triggers. Live deltas are excluded from durable timeline facts by default. Projections are rebuildable and do not replace event_log facts.
- Product-data boundary: App Context identifies one authenticated product data space; it is not a tenant or per-user datastore boundary.

# Requirements and invariants

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-STORE-001

The specification SHALL define schema version 6 and assign only the listed non-session, non-telemetry product tables to this owner.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-STORE-002

Accepted user messages and normalized output SHALL be ingested idempotently; unkeyed repeated text remains distinct and identity collisions fail visibly.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-STORE-003

Over-budget values SHALL use content-addressed external payload storage with deduplication, bounded integrity-checked reads, and durable-preview fallback where exposed.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-STORE-004

History, timeline, room, session, event-command, and read-state services SHALL query product facts with explicit bounds and monotonic cursors.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-STORE-005

Deferred tool payload access SHALL fail closed unless one complete, exact, bounded lifecycle proves session and tool ownership.

# Interfaces and ownership

Capability IDs: `pibo.data.product-store`, `pibo.data.history-projections`.

Implemented public contracts:

- `PIBO_DATA_SCHEMA_VERSION`
- `applyPiboDataSchema`
- `PiboDataStore`
- `createDefaultPiboDataStore`
- `ChatDataIngestService.ingestUserMessageAccepted`
- `ChatDataIngestService.ingestOutputEvent`
- `PiboOutputIdentityCollisionError`
- `PiboEventLogStore.appendEvent`
- `PiboEventLogStore.findByIdempotencyKey`
- `MessageStore.insertMessage`
- `MessageStore.completeAssistantMessagesForTurn`
- `PayloadStore.writePayload`
- `PayloadStore.readPayloadBytesBounded`
- `PayloadStore.readPayloadJsonBounded`
- `PayloadStore.findBySha256`
- `ChatHistoryQueryService.listProductHistoryEntries`
- `ChatHistoryQueryService`
- `ChatHistoryQueryService.getProductHistoryCoverage`
- `ChatTimelineQueryService.listTraceEvents`
- `ChatRoomService`
- `ChatReadStateService`
- `ChatEventCommandService`

Related ownership boundaries:

- SPC-DATA-002 owns sessions and session_runtime_bindings even though those tables share pibo.sqlite.
- SPC-DATA-003 owns telemetry tables in the same database.
- SPC-RUN-007 owns native runtime transcript compatibility; product history is primary.
- SPC-WEB-004 and SPC-WEB-005 own browser overlays and trace rendering, not durable facts.
- ChatProjectService uses web-projects.sqlite and is outside this owner.

# Failure and security behavior

- Bounded payload reads verify size and SHA-256.
- Deferred payload authorization requires exact bounded session/tool/event evidence and fails closed on ambiguity or SQL cap overflow.
- Missing or corrupt external payload content falls back to the durable preview where the history service supports it.

# Known limits

- Non-current claim excluded: assign sessions, runtime bindings, telemetry, or web-projects.sqlite to this owner merely because composition code is nearby.
- Non-current claim excluded: describe ChatNavigationQueryService as a complete native navigation implementation; its source marks it reserved and current call sites compose navigation elsewhere.
- Non-current claim excluded: claim product store code authenticates payload reads; route authentication belongs to Web/security owners.
- Current limit or evidence gap: No focused corruption test was found for bounded payload SHA/length validation and durable-preview fallback.
- Current limit or evidence gap: The canonical inventory names src/data/sqlite-schema.ts, but schema authority is src/data/schema.ts; retain the former only if a concrete symbol remains relevant during drafting.

# Verification and traceability

Source symbols and named tests are bound to commit `38bb6e57f118c1543e7263c68d27e5103d3b1262`. Requirement confidence measures trace quality; it does not claim that an external, browser, real-provider, or Pibo2 check ran.

Package verification commands:

- `npm run build`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `node scripts/run-test-suite.mjs test/data-v2-store.test.mjs test/app-context-fresh-schema.test.mjs test/data-v2-ingest-service.test.mjs test/chat-v2-native-services.test.mjs`

# Related concepts

- SPC-DATA-002 owns sessions and session_runtime_bindings even though those tables share pibo.sqlite.
- SPC-DATA-003 owns telemetry tables in the same database.
- SPC-RUN-007 owns native runtime transcript compatibility; product history is primary.
- SPC-WEB-004 and SPC-WEB-005 own browser overlays and trace rendering, not durable facts.
- ChatProjectService uses web-projects.sqlite and is outside this owner.
